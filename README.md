# CircuitPilot

An AI copilot for electronics design: describe a circuit in plain language and it picks **real parts from the JLCPCB/LCSC database**, draws the schematic, runs ERC, then places and autoroutes a 2-layer PCB you can export as Gerbers. Use Claude, any OpenAI-compatible model or a **local model**, from the browser, your phone, or **Claude Code via MCP**.

![CircuitPilot — ESP32-C3 board schematic](docs/media/schematic.png)

**▶ Try it online: [pcbgo.site](https://pcbgo.site)**: nothing to install. Open ⚙ Settings, paste an API key (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama Cloud, OpenRouter…) and describe your circuit. Projects are saved in your browser. For local models, knowledge folders and Claude Code control, run the desktop version (below).

**From one prompt to a routed board and a 3D-printed case** — the copilot (Gemini Flash Lite) designs an ESP32 board from *"create PCB for ESP"*: real JLCPCB parts, schematic, placement, rip-up autorouting (21/21 nets, DRC 0 errors), GND pours, then a fitted enclosure and a Whoop-style wristband pod (sped up 5×).

**A wearable sensor board, end to end** — with a local model (gpt-oss:120b) from *"Create ESP32-C3 with IMU BMI160 and ECG BMD101 in 4 cm × 4 cm"*: the copilot searches the JLCPCB catalogue and datasheets, wires the schematic (I²C IMU, UART ECG front-end, 3.3 V LDO, USB-C), places and routes the 40 × 40 mm board (all nets routed), shows it in 3D, builds an enclosure and an ECG electrode patch from the wearable templates, and generates the product datasheet PDF (sped up 5×).

## Features

- **Model picker** — Claude (Fable 5.1, Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5, Haiku 4.5) or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, OpenRouter, Ollama, **Ollama Cloud** (via the server proxy), LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM / ExLlama / TabbyAPI, local servers); the context window is detected from the server.
- **Three copilot modes** — **Agent** edits the design with tools, **Ask** is read-only review and Q&A, **Plan** writes a BOM + netlist plan you approve with **Execute plan**.
- **Every palette part is a real JLCPCB part** — the schematic keeps clean symbols while the footprint and pinout come from a specific LCSC part (Basic parts where possible, LEDs by colour); **⇄ JLCPCB parts** converts older designs and **Export → BOM for JLCPCB assembly** matches part numbers for every value.
- **Real component database** — JLCPCB/LCSC search with stock and price; exact pinouts and real footprints for every part, cached locally.
- **Part editor** — create or modify symbols and footprints (generators for SOIC/TSSOP/QFN/DIP/SOT…, draggable pads); saved to *My Library*.
- **Projects** — saved on the server with autosave; same projects on PC and phone.
- **Chat attachments** — 📎 attach photos, PDFs (datasheets), Word or any text file; paste or drag & drop too. Claude reads PDFs natively, other models get the extracted text; images go to vision models.
- **Chat controls** — 🌐 Web search toggle (on by default), 📁 folder for project docs, a context meter (used / window, % left), 🗜 Compress to summarise the chat, and automatic compression at 80% full.
- **Project knowledge** — point a project at a folder of docs, guides and datasheets (md/txt/pdf/docx) the AI follows.
- **Checkpoints** — every Agent message snapshots the design; restore with one click. Full undo/redo.
- **Schematic editor** — built-in parts plus database/custom parts, power symbols, click pin-to-pin wiring, drag, rotate (R), auto-layout.
- **Select, move, copy, paste** — in the schematic and on the PCB: drag a box on empty space to select several parts (Shift+click adds or removes), drag any of them to move the group, **Ctrl+C / Ctrl+X / Ctrl+V / Ctrl+D / Ctrl+A**, **R** rotates and **Del** deletes the selection. Right-click a part (or the selection) for a menu: Cut, Copy, Paste, Duplicate, Rotate, Delete, Properties, Edit symbol & footprint — plus Flip side and Lock position on the PCB. Pasted groups keep their power nets (GND, +3V3…) and their own wiring on new nets. Right- or middle-drag pans.
- **Professional schematic sheets** — an A-series drawing frame with zone markers and a title block (title, company/author, document, sheet *n of m*, date, revision, size) filled from the Documentation fields; toggle it with the *frame* checkbox. **Multi-page schematics**: add sheets with ＋ in the sheet bar (double-click a tab to rename it), move parts between sheets from Properties, and nets that continue on another sheet are drawn as net labels and connected by name. The copilot can use sheets too (`add_sheet`, `move_to_sheet`, `sheet` in `add_components`).
- **Readable spacing enforced** — after every copilot edit the layout is spaced out so that parts *and their net labels* never overlap, no matter where the model put them.
- **PCB** — rule-driven 2-layer autorouter (Web Worker) with vias and neck-down, ratsnest, draggable footprints; routed tracks are straightened into clean 0°/45°/90° runs with a clearance safety margin, so they pass DRC.
- **Routing that keeps trying** — negotiated rip-up and reroute: when a net is stuck, the router finds the nets in its way, rips them up, routes the stuck net and re-routes the others, learning which corridors are contested (history cost), with restarts — for up to the *Autorouter effort* time (Rules, default 90 s), stopping as soon as everything is routed. Progress shows the nets still unrouted; **Stop** keeps the best result so far. No vias on SMD pins (via-in-pad only as a flagged last resort).
- **Placement** — **Auto-place ▾ → Quick place**: annealing that pulls connected parts together (2-pin links like decoupling caps hardest), keeps connectors (USB, headers, jacks) on the board edges and the biggest IC in the centre, runs several tries and keeps the best; with Board size empty it finds the **minimum-area board** (tries three board shapes, shrinks width and height while the placement stays legal) — e.g. 555 example 1124 → ~340 mm². **✦ AI place** asks the model once for a floor plan (JSON mode, compact parts + nets list), then legalises, polishes and routes it — works with local models too.
- **✨ Optimize ▾** — moves parts (local re-arrangement around stuck nets and fresh global arrangements) and re-routes until every net is connected; **…and make the board as small as possible** then shrinks the outline step by step while everything still routes (e.g. 45×26 → 20.5×11.8 mm on the 555 example).
- **Copper pours, arcs, bottom-side parts, curved boards** — GND (or any net) pours with clearance cut-outs; arc tracks; footprints on the bottom side (mirrored, bottom copper/silk/paste); rounded, round/elliptical or custom board outlines.
- **3D board view** — switch the PCB editor between 2D and a 3D render of the manufactured board (both sides, parts, mask colour, pad finish).
- **Enclosure** — a third tab builds a 3D-printable case around the PCB (follows the board outline, height from the tallest part, screw standoffs on PCB mounting holes, automatic openings for USB/jacks and holes above LEDs/buttons, snap-fit lid with vents); exports STL (base + lid) and parametric OpenSCAD.
- **Placement optimizer** — moves / rotates / swaps parts and re-routes until every net is connected (also available to the AI).
- **Gerber export with DRC check** — problems pop up with *Fix on board / Re-route / Optimize / Download anyway*.
- **PCB editor** — Layers panel (show/hide, colour, active layer, dim inactive), PCB Tools (Select, Track `W`, Via `V`, Measure `M`), interactive 45°/90°/any-angle routing with T/B layer switching and automatic vias, live clearance check, track/via properties, segment delete; the autorouter keeps hand-routed tracks.
- **Design rules & DRC** — JLCPCB 2-layer defaults, editable per project (trace/power widths, per-net widths, clearance, vias, edge clearance, layers); exact-geometry DRC with markers on the board.
- **Exports** — Gerber + Excellon drill (.zip), BOM (.csv), netlist (.net), schematic and PCB SVG, project JSON.
- **One-click ordering** — **Order at JLCPCB ↗** (PCB toolbar) runs DRC, matches LCSC parts, saves the Gerber zip plus the assembly BOM and pick-and-place (CPL) files, and opens the JLCPCB quote page: drop the zip on *Add gerber file*, and for assembly upload the two .csv files. **Order 3D print ↗** (Enclosure toolbar) builds high-resolution STLs and opens the JLC3DP quote page. (JLCPCB has no public upload link, so you drag the downloaded files in yourself.)
- **Internet access for the AI** — `web_search` and `web_fetch` let any model (Claude, Gemini, local Qwen …) look up datasheets, application notes, prices and anything else, reading web pages and PDF datasheets; private / local addresses are blocked. Toggle in ⚙ Settings (DuckDuckGo by default, optional Brave Search key).
- **Light / dark theme** — header button cycles 🖥 System → ☀ Light → 🌙 Dark (remembered per browser; the PCB canvas stays black for layer contrast).
- **Automation** — MCP server for Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Cursor, plus a REST + OpenAPI interface.

## Web version and desktop version

| | Web version (GitHub Pages) | Desktop version (`server.py`) |
|---|---|---|
| Install | none, open the link | Python 3, `python server.py 5173` |
| Projects and My Library | saved in your browser (export `.json` to back up) | `projects.db` on your PC, shared by all your devices |
| Part search, web search, Ollama Cloud | through the [CircuitPilot relay](relay/README.md) | direct from your PC |
| Cloud AI (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter…) | yes | yes |
| Local models (llama.cpp, LM Studio, Ollama) | yes, with CORS enabled in the model server | yes, no setup |
| Chat attachments | PDF, images, text | PDF, Word, images, text |
| Knowledge folders, Claude Code (MCP) | no | yes |

The web version is the same app: when it is not served by `server.py`, `js/static-backend.js` answers the app's requests in the browser.

**Local models in the web version** need the model server to accept requests from the web page (CORS): Ollama with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=https://pcbgo.site`, LM Studio with *Enable CORS* in the server settings, llama.cpp's `llama-server` allows it by default. Your browser may ask for permission to reach devices on your local network.

## Run

No build step and no dependencies. Start the bundled server (static files + a proxy for local model servers):

```bash
python server.py 5173
```

On Windows you can simply double-click **`start.bat`** (starts the server, shows the LAN address, optionally opens a public Cloudflare link). Open http://localhost:5173 (or `http://<your-PC-IP>:5173` from another device on your LAN), then open **⚙ Settings** and add an API key.

API keys are stored in your browser's localStorage and sent directly from the page to the provider you choose — fine for personal/local use, but don't host it publicly with keys baked in.

## Limitations

- Palette parts (resistor, capacitor, LED, diodes, transistors, MOSFETs, regulator, op-amp, crystal, fuse, inductor, potentiometer, buzzer) are backed by real JLCPCB parts — their footprints and pinouts come from the part library and pins are matched by name, so e.g. the AMS1117's IN/OUT/tab and each LED's cathode land on the right pads. Pin headers / generic connectors and the push button keep standard generated footprints (a 4-pin tact switch's internal pairs are not documented in the library); if you pick a generated footprint from the Footprint menu, verify its pin order against your part's datasheet.
- The router works on a grid; very dense boards can still leave a net unrouted within the time budget — run **✨ Optimize**, add a GND pour, or give it a bigger board.
- Touch editing (drag/pinch) on phones is not implemented yet.

## Local models (llama.cpp, TabbyAPI, LM Studio, Ollama…)

In **⚙ Settings → OpenAI-compatible**, enter the server URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/v1` or click the **Local :8080** preset). The model list is fetched automatically from `/v1/models` and appears in the model picker. The model must support OpenAI-style tool calling for Agent mode.

Requests to `localhost` servers are routed through `server.py` (`/llm-proxy/<port>/...`), so local models work even when they only listen on 127.0.0.1 or don't send CORS headers — including from a phone on your LAN.

## Public URL (Cloudflare tunnel)

```bash
python server.py 5173 --allow-ports 8080 --password YOUR_PASSWORD
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173
```

Always set a password when exposing the app: the LLM proxy gives access to your local model. The proxy only forwards to ports listed in `--allow-ports` (default `8080`).

## Component database (JLCPCB / LCSC)

Type a part number in the Parts search box (e.g. `ESP32-C3`, `AMS1117`, `CH340C`, `USB-C`) to search the JLCPCB/LCSC catalogue (stock, price, Basic/Extended). Click a result to place it: the exact pinout and real PCB footprint are loaded from the part library (see *Data sources* below).

The AI copilot has the same database through the `search_parts` and `get_part` tools, so you can ask for e.g. *"ESP32-C3 board with USB-C, AMS1117 regulator and a status LED"* and it will pick real in-stock parts.

Everything fetched is cached in a local SQLite database (`parts.db`), so parts you've used keep working offline. Part definitions are also saved inside each design file.

## Projects

Projects are stored on the server (`projects.db`, SQLite) and saved automatically — the status next to the project name shows **✓ Saved**. Use **▤ Projects** to open, duplicate, rename, delete or import projects, **＋ New** to start one, and **Save as…** (`Ctrl+Shift+S`) to save the current design under a new name and continue in the copy. The same projects appear on every device that opens the app. **Export → Project file (.json)** downloads a portable copy.

## Part editor (custom symbols & footprints)

- **＋ New part** (Parts panel) opens the editor: pins (number, name, side L/R/T/B, bulk edit), live symbol preview, and a footprint editor with generators (0805, SOT-23, SOT-223, SOIC-n, TSSOP-n, QFN-n(-EP), DIP-n, pin headers…), draggable pads (0.05 mm snap) and per-pad size/shape/drill.
- Select any placed part → **✎ Edit symbol & footprint** to fix a database part, or **✎ Make editable part** to turn a built-in part into a custom one.
- Saved parts go to **My Library** (shared across projects); every placed instance updates when you edit a part.
- The AI can do the same with the `create_part` / `update_part` tools.

## Project knowledge folder

Click **📚 Knowledge** in the copilot and enter a folder on the PC running the server. Design notes, requirements, coding/naming rules and datasheets (`.md .txt .pdf .docx .csv .json`, source code…) are given to the AI: small documents go straight into its context, the rest it searches and reads with `knowledge_search` / `knowledge_read`. Try it with [`examples/knowledge`](examples/knowledge).

Only document-type files inside the chosen folder are read (no `..` escapes, hidden folders and `.git`/`node_modules` are skipped). Anyone who can log in to the app can point it at a folder on the server PC, so keep the password private.

## Control from Claude Code (MCP) and other tools

`mcp/circuitpilot-mcp.mjs` exposes all 49 design tools — projects, parts database, schematic editing, ERC, custom parts, knowledge, PCB generation, Gerber export — through the **Model Context Protocol**. It runs the same engine as the browser app and talks to the running `server.py`, so every change shows up live in the browser.

**Claude Code** — this repo ships a `.mcp.json`, so just open the folder in Claude Code (with `server.py` running) and approve the `circuitpilot` server. Or add it globally:

```bash
claude mcp add circuitpilot -e CP_URL=http://localhost:5173 -- node /path/to/CircuitPilot/mcp/circuitpilot-mcp.mjs
```

Then ask e.g. *"Using circuitpilot, create a project 'ESP32 sensor board' with an ESP32-C3-MINI-1, AMS1117 and USB-C, then generate the PCB and export Gerbers to ./fab"*.

The password is read from `access-password.txt` (or set `CP_PASSWORD`). Other MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code…) use the same command.

**REST / OpenAPI** for anything else (scripts, n8n, OpenAI function calling…):

```bash
node mcp/circuitpilot-mcp.mjs --http 5174
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <password>" http://127.0.0.1:5174/tools
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <password>" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5174/tools/search_parts -d '{"query":"CH340C"}'
```

`GET /openapi.json` returns an OpenAPI 3.1 spec of every tool. Add `"project": "<id or name>"` to any call to switch project. The REST server listens on 127.0.0.1 only (add `--public` to expose it).

## Design rules (JLCPCB defaults) and DRC

**PCB → ⚙ Rules** edits the project's design rules. The autorouter follows them and **DRC** checks the finished board against them.

| Rule | Default (JLCPCB 2-layer, recommended) | JLCPCB minimum |
|---|---|---|
| Trace width | 0.25 mm | 0.127 mm (5 mil) |
| Power / GND trace width (only with *Wider tracks for power / GND nets*) | 0.5 mm | — |
| Clearance (copper–copper) | 0.2 mm | 0.127 mm (5 mil) |
| Via diameter / drill | 0.6 / 0.3 mm | 0.5 / 0.3 mm, annular ring 0.13 mm |
| Copper to board edge | 0.3 mm | 0.3 mm |
| Hole to hole | — | 0.5 mm |

- Presets: **JLCPCB recommended**, **JLCPCB minimum (5/5 mil)**, **JLCPCB power/robust**, **Home etching / CNC (1 layer)** — then tweak any value.
- **One width by default**: every net is routed with the trace width; tick *Wider tracks for power / GND nets* in Rules to give power and ground the power width. **Per-net widths** (e.g. `+5V` 0.8 mm, `MOTOR` 1.2 mm) override both.
- **Changing widths after routing**: click a track — its whole net lights up (the rest is dimmed), the net name shows on the board, and Properties lists the net's tracks, vias and pins. Set the width for that track, the whole net, or every track (DRC reports at once if something no longer fits); *Reset wide tracks to rule width* brings wider tracks back to the rule.
- **Neck-down**: when a wide trace can't reach a fine-pitch pad, the router narrows it (power width → trace width → fab minimum) and reports which nets were necked down.
- Clearance is computed against the real pad shapes, so traces escape fine-pitch QFN/USB-C pads at JLCPCB clearances. Vias are allowed inside a net's own large pads (e.g. module ground pads).
- **DRC** uses exact geometry: shorts and clearance, trace width, via drill and annular ring, hole-to-hole spacing, copper-to-edge, unrouted nets, and rules set below the fab minimums. Click a violation to zoom to it.
- The AI and MCP/REST clients get `get_design_rules`, `set_design_rules` and `run_drc`; `generate_pcb` reports the DRC result.

Values follow JLCPCB's published capabilities; check [jlcpcb.com/capabilities](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/pcb-capabilities) for the latest before ordering.

## PCB editor

**⟳ Update from schematic** loads schematic edits onto the board without placing or routing anything: new parts are lined up beside the board with their ratsnest for you to drag into place, changed footprints update in place, and tracks of deleted nets are removed. Schematic edits no longer wipe a net's routing — adding a part to GND keeps every GND track, and a footprint change or removed part only drops the tracks on that part's pads. (The copilot's `update_pcb_from_schematic` tool also places the new parts and routes what is missing.)

**Footprints for passives**: resistors, capacitors, inductors and LEDs can be switched between the JLCPCB part's own footprint (shown as e.g. *0603 · JLCPCB C25804*) and standard 0402 / 0603 / 0805 / 1206 / THT footprints in Properties; the assembly BOM then matches an LCSC part in the new package.

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Layers | **Layers** panel: eye = show/hide, swatch = colour, click a copper layer = make it active; **All / None / Top / Bot** quick views; *Dim inactive copper* |
| Select / move | `S` or `Esc` — click a footprint, track segment or via; drag footprints and vias; double-click a track to select all of it; `R` rotates a footprint |
| Route a track | `W`, click a pad / via / track to start (net is taken from it), click to add corners, click a pad of the same net to finish |
| While routing | `T` / `B` / `L` / `V` switch layer (adds a via) · `Space` cycles 45° / 90° / any angle · `/` flips the bend · `+` / `-` width · `Backspace` removes the last corner · `Esc` or right-click finishes |
| Via | `V`, click to place (takes the net of what is under it) |
| Measure | `M`, click two points (mm and mil) |
| Delete | select, then `Del` (a segment splits its track) |
| Edit | select a track or via → change net, layer, width / diameter, drill, position in **Properties** |

Live feedback: the coordinate bar shows X/Y, layer, width, net, and warns when the track being drawn violates the clearance rule; vias placed while routing are checked too. **Route** (autorouter) keeps every hand-drawn track and re-routes the rest with rip-up; the ratsnest and the “routed” count follow the real copper.

### Connectors on the board edge

**Board size is kept**: once a board exists (or you type a size in Board W×H), Auto-place and Generate PCB fit the parts *inside* the existing outline — rectangle, rounded, round or custom — scaling the schematic arrangement to the board, keeping parts inside the edge clearance, rotating long parts and tightening spacing when crowded. The board is never enlarged on its own: if the parts cannot fit you get a message with how much of the board they need. Clear the Board W×H boxes to size the board to the parts instead. The ✨ Optimizer also keeps the board size.

**Generate PCB** puts connectors on the nearest board edge automatically: USB, DC jacks, RF and card connectors are rotated so the **opening faces outward, flush with the edge** (so a cable can plug in); pin headers and terminals sit just inside the edge. To choose the edge yourself, select the footprint on the PCB and click **⇤ Left / ⤒ Top / ⤓ Bottom / Right ⇥** in Properties — or ask the AI ("put the USB connector on the bottom edge"), which uses the `place_footprint` tool. The choice is remembered for later re-placements; press **Route** afterwards to reconnect.

### More PCB tools

| Feature | How |
|---|---|
| Copper pour | **⬛ Pour GND** (whole board, both layers) or the **Copper area** tool `E`: click corners, click the first corner to close; set net / layer / clearance in Properties. Other nets keep the clearance rule, same-net pads/tracks connect, the outline edge clearance is respected. Exported with clearance cut-outs. |
| Arc track | `A`: click start, click end, click to set the curve. |
| Drag tracks | Select tool: drag a segment (neighbours stay attached; a new corner is added at pads) or drag a corner. |
| Bottom side | Select a footprint → **▼ Bottom** in Properties (mirrored, SMD pads on BottomLayer, BottomSilk, bottom paste/mask). The AI: `place_footprint {side: "bottom"}`. |
| Board outline | **▭ Board**: rectangle, rounded rectangle, circle/ellipse, or **Draw outline** (custom polygon with rounded corners). Router, DRC, pours and the Edge_Cuts Gerber follow it. |
| Optimize | **✨ Optimize** moves, rotates and swaps parts (and can grow the board) and re-routes until everything connects, keeping the best result. Connectors on edges stay put. The AI: `optimize_pcb`, or `get_pcb_layout` + `place_footprint` + `route_pcb`. |
| Gerbers | **Gerbers ⤓** runs DRC first. If anything is wrong a window lists it (click to zoom) with **Fix on board · Re-route · Optimize placement · Download anyway**. Export includes copper, mask, paste, silkscreen (top + bottom), outline and drill. Via MCP, `export_gerbers` refuses on DRC errors unless `force: true`. |

## Enclosure (3D print)

The **Enclosure** tab builds a printable case around the current PCB and previews it in 3D (drag to orbit, right-drag to pan, wheel to zoom; *Explode*, *X-ray*, *Lid*, *PCB* toggles).

- **Fits the board**: the cavity follows the board outline (rectangle, rounded, round or custom) plus a clearance gap; the height comes from the tallest part (estimated per package — override any part height).
- **Board support**: click **＋ Add M3 mounting holes** (adds non-plated Ø3.2 mm holes to the PCB, kept clear of parts and copper, in the NPTH drill file) to get **screw standoffs**; without holes the board rests on corner supports. Standoffs rise automatically to clear parts on the bottom side.
- **Openings**: automatic for edge connectors (USB, DC jack…, at the right wall and height) and holes in the lid above LEDs and buttons; add your own rectangle / circle cutouts on any wall, the lid or the floor.
- **Lid**: snap-fit lip with an adjustable fit tolerance, optional vent slots.
- **Export**: **STL ⤓** (base + lid; the lid is already oriented for printing), **OpenSCAD ⤓** (parametric source of the same design), or **All (.zip)** with print notes.
- **AI**: "make the walls 3 mm, add a 6×4 mm cable slot on the right and more room above the board" → `set_enclosure`, `add_enclosure_cutout`, `add_mounting_holes`, `get_enclosure`; Claude Code can also `export_enclosure` straight to a folder.

### Custom 3D designs (wearables, patches, organic cases)

Switch the Enclosure tab to **Custom 3D** for anything that is not a box: a Whoop-style **wristband pod** with a curved underside and strap lugs, an **ECG chest patch** with snap-electrode holes, clips, mounts, rounded or organic housings. Just describe it to the AI:

The AI writes a short **3D script** (`set_enclosure_script`): rounded boxes, convex hulls, extrude / revolve, union / difference / intersection, transforms — positioned relative to the PCB, whose outline, part boxes, heights and edge connectors it gets as context. Every build returns a **fit report** (printed parts colliding with the board or components, script errors with line numbers), so the AI iterates until it is clean.

- **35 tested templates**, all sized from your board: 10 wrist wearables (Whoop-style pod, round / square / hex / octagon watches with spring-bar lugs, capsules, slim bands, cuffs — concave wrist backs), 10 chest / ECG (3-lead oval, heart-rate strap pod, Holter 5-lead with belt clip, round and hex 3-electrode patches, adhesive patches with flange, lead-wire box, 4-electrode patch), 7 other body-worn (ankle, arm, headband, pendant, key fob, belt clip, badge) and 8 boxes. Every template is checked on real boards: the PCB and every part are inside, nothing collides, every printed part is watertight.
- **Enclosure kit** for the AI and for your own scripts: `envelope()` (board + every part), outlines that contain it (oval, circle, pill, hex, octagon, squircle), soft rounded bodies, wrist curves, strap lugs, snap-electrode holes, belt clips, loops, connector openings, LED / button windows, board posts, and a lid with a press-fit lip.
- **</> Script** opens the editor (Ctrl+Enter to build, templates: wristband pod, ECG patch, rounded box; **?** shows the API).
- Builds run in a sandboxed Web Worker (no network access) and produce **watertight meshes**.
- **Export**: one **STL per part** (lids/covers flipped for printing), equivalent **OpenSCAD** source, and the script itself in the zip.

The geometry engine (CSG with watertight-mesh repair) is self-contained JavaScript, so it runs in the browser and in the MCP server; only the 3D preview loads three.js from cdnjs.

## Documentation (product datasheet PDF)

The **Documentation** tab turns the design into a product datasheet — previewed live, exported with **PDF ⤓**:

- cover with title, tagline, 3D render and key specifications; description, features and applications (**✦ Write with AI** drafts them from the design; edit them in the side panel)
- main components and power rails, full schematic
- PCB: 3D renders of the top and bottom, copper layout, PCB / fabrication specifications (size, layers, track / space, vias, holes, routing, DRC / ERC)
- mechanical drawing with board dimensions, mounting holes and edge connectors; connector pinout tables
- enclosure renders (assembled and exploded) with dimensions; bill of materials with LCSC numbers; revision table

Enclosure **STL ⤓** files are always rebuilt at high resolution (≈0.4 mm curve segments) so they can go straight to a 3D-printing service; the on-screen preview stays fast.

## EasyEDA interchange

- **Export → Schematic for EasyEDA (.json)** writes the schematic as an EasyEDA Standard document (symbols, pins, net labels, LCSC part numbers). Open it in EasyEDA Standard with *File → Open → EasyEDA Source*, or in EasyEDA Pro with *File → Import → EasyEDA (Standard)*. Every part with an LCSC number is linked to its EasyEDA library symbol and footprint, so EasyEDA's *Footprints Verification* finds them (parts without an LCSC number get their footprint chosen in EasyEDA).
- **Projects → Import .json / EasyEDA PCB** opens an EasyEDA Standard PCB (*File → Export → EasyEDA Source* in EasyEDA) as a new project: footprints become library parts (LCSC numbers kept), with placement (top/bottom, rotation), nets, tracks, vias, holes, copper areas and the board outline; a schematic is generated from the nets.

## Data sources & licenses

CircuitPilot's design, code and UI are original work. It uses third-party **data and libraries**, credited here as their terms require:
